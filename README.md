# eComm
###

This project is aimed at building an open-source e-commerce platform based on AngularJS using a cutting-edge technology stack. I am building an efficient and rich user interface for this online shopping application.

The eComm is aimed to be a modular platform which allows merchants to configure, supplement or replace any functionality they need. As an owner of website, the application allows you to fully control your e-Commerce website by defining your products, product categories, different types of offers, etc. And as a customer, you have a few features such as shopping cart, product advanced search, feedback, etc.
